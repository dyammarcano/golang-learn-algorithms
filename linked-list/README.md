## Description

A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which points to the next element in the sequence. Each element in a linked list is called a node. A node consists of two parts: data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

## Comparison of Singly Linked Lists with Arrays & Dynamic Arrays

| Operation | Linked List | Array | Dynamic Array |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Insertion/Deletion at beginning | O(1) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Insertion/Deletion at end | O(n) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Insertion/Deletion in middle | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |
| Size | O(n) | O(n) | O(n) |

Based on the comparison, linked lists are efficient for insertion and deletion operations but inefficient for access operations. Arrays are efficient for access operations but inefficient for insertion and deletion operations. Dynamic arrays provide a balance between access and insertion/deletion operations.
